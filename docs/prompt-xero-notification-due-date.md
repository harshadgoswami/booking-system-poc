We are using xero accounting software where we send invoice to guest for payment plan wise invoice
it can be montly weekly ...

notify date is date when we are sending invoice to guest into xero it is 16 days before checkin date
due date is the last date for payment which is 7 days before checkin date

so if checkin date : 1st feb 2026 , checkout date: 28th feb 2026
then notify date is : 1st feb 2026 - 16 days
and due date is : 1st feb 2026 - 7 days
